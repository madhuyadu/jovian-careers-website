# jovian-careers-website
Hi all,
This is my first non-analytics project and hence very excited about the same.
In this Project, I have created a sample Careers website with basic features.
In future, I look forward to building upon this work and enrich this site with many more features.
I am basically not a front-end developer and hence used readily available templates online to quickly build this site. But after this work, I am quite curious to learn front-end development little deeper & take this work forward.

I would like to sincerely thank Mr. Akash N S from Jovian Community, whose guidance & videos helped me end to end in this work.

Here is the brief summary of my work:
- Programming languages used: html, css, bootstrap, Python
- Used Python programming language with Flask for developing this web framework
- Used html (with support from htmldog.com) for web page development & CSS for styling aspects
- Used readily available bootstrap templates from getbootstrap.com for quick web development
- Used replit.com for testing & developing my code quickly, also used this platform for version control, integrating with Github as and when new changes were made
- Used render.com for hosting the Flask app developed on Production server. Deployed the app using this platform & also created this website
