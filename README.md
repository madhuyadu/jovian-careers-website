# Jovian-careers-website
# Project details:
This is my first non-analytics project and hence I am very excited about the same.<br />
In this Project, I have created a sample Careers website with basic features.<br />
In future, I look forward to building upon this work and enrich this site with many more features.<br />
I am basically not a front-end developer and hence used readily available templates online to quickly build this site.<br />
But after this work, I am quite curious to learn front-end development little deeper & take this work forward.

Here is the brief summary of my work:
- Programming languages used: html, css, bootstrap, Python
- Python programming language with Flask for developing this web framework
- html (with support from htmldog.com) for web page development & CSS for styling aspects
- Readily available bootstrap templates from getbootstrap.com for quick web development
- replit.com for testing & developing my code quickly, also used this platform for version control, integrating with Github as and when new changes were made
- render.com for hosting the Flask app developed on Production server. Deployed the app using this platform & also created this website
